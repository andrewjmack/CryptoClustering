# CryptoClustering
Univ of Denver: Data Analytics | July 2024 | Andrew Mack

### Summary
The purpose of this proejct is to utilize knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

The following stages were involved:
- Finding the best value for k after scaling a dataframe
- Clustering the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data
- Optimizing the clusters with Principal Component Analysis ("PCA")
- Finding the best value for k using the PCA data
- Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data

### Contents
This repository includes the original data in a .csv file and a Jupyter Notebook in which the .csv data was transformed and the analysis occurred:

    - Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
    - Resources/crypto_market_data.csv
    - README.md
